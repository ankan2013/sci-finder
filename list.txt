Ideas for common case parsing:

Title: check <h*>

Authors: 1) check <div> and <span> and maybe <dl> with an attribute such as itemprop or class containing "author" as a substring of the value
    2) check next_siblings after the title
    3) maybe look for the word Authors in the whole text, get the tag, check siblings or siblings of the parent or grandparent tag

Abstract: 1) check div, dl and span class and itemprop values
        2) look for the word Abstract, maybe contained in h*
        3) look for long text in a single tag

DOI: practically always: look for "DOI " (!!! - a unique identifier for pdf search)
although doi may not present on a page... (maybe it doesn't exist for this article at all (?))

Received date: different values of attrs and different tags, maybe the best option is looking for Date word in the text and maybe recognize that smth is a for of date notation
